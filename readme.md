Pointer Lock Example
====================

A (hopefully) simple example of doing pointer lock with GLFW. Maybe it can be used to find out what Xlib commands are needed to implement pointer lock in an app.

Hover over the window and click to lock the pointer.

Once the pointer is locked, hold down LMB to drag the cube, or RMB to rotate the cube.
